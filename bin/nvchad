# Usage: nvchad [COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS_AND_ARGUMENTS_FOR_NEOVIM...]
#
# Runs NeoVim with NvChad configuration in a bubblewrap container.

# * https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap
#
# This helps you gradually transition to NvChad, as you can still
# start NeoVim with your original configuration by running `nvim`.
# Similarly, you can start NeoVim with NvChad by running `nvchad`.
